# WebSapient MVC CMS
### A Content Management System based on the Model-View-Controller Architecture

## Project Summary
The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate thinking like a programmer to break down what a basic CMS requires and translate my thinking into code. After sufficient development and testing, this CMS will be suitable for use in a production environment. 


## Project Languages and Technologies
- PHP
- - Composer
- - Symfony
- JavaScript
- - NodeJS
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- SQL/MySQL
- - MariaDB
- Apache
- Nginx (later on)


## Architecture
_Model_ - The data layer. This will be the realm of classes and objects used in the CMS.

_View_ - The public-facing web pages and admin panels

_Controller - Manages and routes requests


## Modules
Ultimately, I want to take an atomic approach to building this project. As such, it will be a work in progress as I rethink and refactor the code during development. At first, I'll focus on making everything as modular as possible, with a focus on separation of concerns. 

Another aim of this project is to utilize design patterns where they make sense and simplify the codebase while delivering the outputs necessary for the CMS to function properly. 

As of right now, here is the breakdown of this project as I see it: 

- Demo Website
- Admin Area
- Users
- - User Roles
- Authentication
- Session Management
- Database
- HTTP Routing
- Internal Routing
- Templates
- - Core Templates
- - Template Partials
- Content Editor
- - Editor Interface
- Dynamic Content
- Forms
- - Contact
- - Email Subscription
- - Reviews
- - Testimonials

## Some Nice-To-Haves
- Technical SEO Optimization
- - Metadata
- - Keywords
- - Local SEO
- - On-Page SEO
 
- Memberships
- Ecommerce
- - Paid Subscriptions
- - Product and Service Purchases
 
- Automatic Image Optimization
- - Optimize to 1MB or less without visible loss of quality
 
- Automatic bundling of JS and CSS for fast page load speeds

- Convert front-end PHP to React once CMS is ready for production

- Convert CMS to a headless architecture

- SSO authentication

- Social Shares

- Social Posts by Content Author

- Design System
- - Reusable
- - Duplicable
- - Exportable (CMS agnostic?)
 
- Drag-and-Drop Page Builder

- Automatic Templating
- - For dynamic content, based on where it's to be displayed (website post, Facebook, Instagram, etc.)

## Conclusion
The core idea here is to create a CMS that is lean, fast, and secure. That's Phase I. Phase II will be the creation and implementation of select "Nice-To-Have" modules that would add value to the user experience of the CMS.
